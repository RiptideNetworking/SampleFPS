<h1 align="center">Sample FPS Game Using Riptide Networking</h1>

This is the source code for my [Riptide tutorial series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXkn83W0Qkfn3qF7NU4OEtVwOD6U2wphJ) on YouTube, where we build this multiplayer first person shooter to demonstrate how [Riptide Networking](https://github.com/RiptideNetworking/Riptide) works. Check out [part 1](https://youtu.be/6kWNZOFcFQw).

There's a branch containing the code for each video in the series.

**Please DO NOT create issues for help with resolving any problems you encounter while following along with the videos—use [the Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/tomweiland) for that. Issues should be reserved for bugs that are present within the code of this repository!**

## Donate

Riptide is 100% free to use, but if you'd like to financially support Riptide's development and get early access to new features, you can do so through [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/tom-weiland). I really appreciate any and all support :D
